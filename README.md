# Dimensional arithmetics in Swift

This package provides an easy and natural way of dealing with physical sizes. Performing complex arithmetics or unit conversion is as easy as using ``Double`` values. Check out the code below, to get a glimpse on what is possible with this package.

```swift
let area = 2.4[.m] * 5.86[.inch] // Area of a rectangle 2.4m x 5.86"
let force = 52.36[.lb] * SI.g // Force exceeded by a mass of 52.36‚Ñî under gravity
let pressure = force / area // Calculate the pressure.
print(pressure.convert(to: .Pa))
```

> **TLDR**  
> - Install this package like any other Swift package using the Swift package manager.
> - Construct an ``SI`` number using ``SI(_ value: Double, _ unit: SI.Unit)`` or the subscript notation
>   ```swift
>   let v1 = SI(2.5, .m / .s)
>   let v2 = 2.5[.m / .s]
>   ```
> - Perform any calculations you would do with a double, ``SI`` will take care of the rest.
> - To convert an ``SI`` number to a desired unit use ``convert(to: SI.Unit)``
> - Define custom units by natural calculation e.g.
>   ```swift
>   let N = .kg * .m / .s ** 2
>   let lb = SI.Unit("‚Ñî", 0.45359237 * kg) 
>   ```
> - You can use physical constants provided under ``SI``


## Basic usage

Every ``SI`` number consists of a ``value`` and a ``unit``. When performing arithmetic operations, the unit of a number is considered to ensure physical accuracy and proper conversion. Adding e.g. *1 m* to *500 mm* will return *1.5 m*, while an addition with *1 s* will result in an error since the physical dimensions of the units mismatch.

### Construction

To construct an ``SI``number you have three options:

1. Using the ``SI`` initializer
   ```swift
   let myLength = SI(2.5, SI.Unit.m) // 2.5 meters
   let myVelocity = SI(2.5, .m / .s) // 2.5 meters per second
   let myScalar = SI(2.5) // 2.5 (scalar value)
   ```
2. Using the subscript shortcut. With this you can create an ``SI`` on the fly subscripting of a ``Double``
   ```swift
   let myLength = 2.5[SI.Unit.m] // 2.5 meters
   let myVelocity = 2.5[.m / .s] // 2.5 meters per second
   let myScalar = 2.5[] // 2.5 (empty subscript for scalar value)
   ```

### Initialization

You can use ``SI`` like a ``Double`` without the struggle of keeping track of unit conversions. Here are some examples

```swift
let l1 = 2[.m] // 2 meters
let l2 = 500[.mm] // 500 millimeters = 0.5 meters

l1 + l2 // 2.5m (2.5[.m])
l1 - l2 // 1.5m (1.5[.m])
l1 * l2 // 1m¬≤ (1[.m ** 2])
l1 / l2 // 4 (4[])
2 * l1 // 4m (4[.m])
l1 ** 2 // 4m¬≤ (4[.m ** 2])
pow(l1, 2) // 4m¬≤ (4[.m ** 2])
sqrt(l1 * l2) // 1m (1[.m])
```

> **Caution** Be careful when adding two ``SI`` numbers with mismatching physical dimensions e.g. ``1[.m] + 2[.s]`` since this will result in a precondition failure.

### Conversion

To convert an ``SI`` number to a desired unit use ``convert()`` or ``convertToSI()`` to convert to an SI unit.

```swift
let myLength = 2.5[.inch].convertToSI() // 0.063 m
let myTime = 24[.hour].convert(to: .day) // 1.0 day
```

> **Caution** Be careful when converting an ``SI`` number to a unit with mismatching physical dimensions e.g. ``1[.m].convert(to: .s)`` since this will result in a precondition failure.

To typecast an ``SI`` to an ``Int`` or ``Double`` just use the initializer.

```swift
let double = Double(2[.m] / 2[.mm]) // 1000.0
let int = Double(2[.mm] / 2[.m]) // 1000
```

> **Caution** Be careful when typecasting an ``SI`` with a non-scalar physical dimensions e.g. ``Double(1.2[.m])`` since this will result in a precondition failure.

## Custom Units

If you find your unit missing in the library of ``SI.Unit``, you can easily create one.

### Creating units on the fly

``SI.Unit`` supports multiplication, division and exponentiation so creating a new unit in place is really easy. 

```swift
let N = .kg * .m / .s ** 2 // Newton
let lb = 0.45359237 * .kg // Pound
```

### Prefixes

To add a prefix to a unit (e.g. N ‚Üí kN, m ‚Üí Œº), you can use the inbuilt methods.
```swift
let Œºm = Œº(.m) // Micrometer: 1 Œºm = 10‚Åª‚Å∂ m
let kN = k(.N) // Kilonewton: 1 kN = 10¬≥ N
```

### Define a named unit

To define a named ``SI.Unit`` you must use the initializer. You can create a new ``SI.Unit`` based of an existing one or one created on the fly. The name is used in the ``customDebugString``.

> **Tip** Add your named units as an extension of ``SI.Unit`` to make them easily available.

```swift
extension SI.Unit {
   public static let N = Self("N", kg * m / (s ** 2)) // Force in Newton
}
let Hz = SI.Unit("Hz", .scalar / .s) // Frequency in Hertz
```

### Unit dimension

An ``SI.Unit`` consists of a ``dimension`` and a ``multiplicator``. The ``dimension`` is a dictionary of type ``[SI.Unit.Base : Int]`` where the key stands for the respective Base dimension and the value for its power. For example
```swift
SI.Unit("m/s", .m / .s).dimension = [SI.Unit.Base.m: 1, SI.Unit.Base.s: -1]
```
The ``multiplicator`` is used to convert the unit to the SI system.

All standard base units are provided in the ``SI`` package. To define a new base unit (e.g. ‚Ç¨, happiness,...) extend of ``SI.Unit.Base`` and use the default initializer and provide the standard symbol. Then define the standard unit of the new dimension providing the new ``dimension``, the ``multiplicator`` and a ``name``.
```swift
extension SI.Unit.Base{
   public static let currency = Self(name: "‚Ç¨")
}
extension SI.Unit {
   public static let euro = Self("‚Ç¨", 1, [Base.currency: 1])
}
```
